# TryHackMe Rooms: Governance & Regulation | Cyber Kill Chain  
**Level:** Beginner/Easy  

## ðŸ›¡ Governance & Regulation  
This room introduced the role and importance of governance in cybersecurity. It covered how laws, standards, and frameworks guide organisations in protecting sensitive information.  

**Key Concepts Covered:**  
- Importance of Governance & Regulation in cybersecurity  
- Governance, Risk Management & Compliance (GRC) framework  
- Privacy and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)  
- Information security frameworks: ISO/IEC 27001, NIST 800-53, NIST SP 800-63B  
- Information Security Management and compliance processes  

**Takeaway:**  
An effective governance and regulation framework helps organisations proactively manage risk, maintain compliance, and safeguard assets, even though 100% security can never be achieved.

## ðŸ”’ The Cyber Kill Chain  
This room explained the **Cyber Kill ChainÂ®**, developed by Lockheed Martin, which adapts a military concept to describe the stages of a cyberattack.  

**Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain:**  
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Weaponization  
3. Delivery  
4. Exploitation  
5. Installation  
6. Command & Control  
7. Actions on Objectives  

**Why It Matters:**  
- Helps defenders recognize attack stages and disrupt intrusions  
- Useful for SOC Analysts, Threat Hunters, and Incident Responders  
- Provides insight into ransomware, APTs, and security breaches  

**Limitations:**  
- Last updated in 2011, focused mainly on perimeter security and malware  
- Doesnâ€™t account well for modern threats (e.g., insider threats, TTP variations)  
- Best used alongside **MITRE ATT&CK** and **Unified Kill Chain** frameworks  

**Takeaway:**  
Understanding the Kill Chain is valuable for identifying and breaking an attack, but modern defense requires a multi-framework approach.
